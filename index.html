                <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done
                    by
                    foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without
                    luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays
                    between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.

                <h3 class="text-start">Etymology</h3>
                <p>In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle.
                    According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words
                    travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture
                    called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).

            <div class="col-4 bg-danger mt-4">

                <h3 class="text-start">Purpose and motivation</h3>
                <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for
                    leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8]
                    While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by
                    trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many many years.

        Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and
        to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or
        sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from
        village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral
        support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various
        crusades and in sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and
        involved streams of travelers both locally and internationally.[10]
